# FatCow Icons

This is a set of iconsfrom FatCow at version 3.9.2 made available for free.

The original home of these icons is at https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons.

**I am allowed to host these icons here by the FatCow support.**

## To-Do

Consider detecting scroll direction (up ro down) and rendering the virtual list
window in that direction as well to make scrolling up appear a bit nicer.

Consider allowing to associate custom aliases with the icons which would be taken
into an account in search. This would be helpful with synonyms etc. Storing it
in the local storage should be sufficient.

Consider aliasing icons with common synonyms (how to tell? Google Analytics for
when a user adds a custom alias?) by default by placing another file in the repo
with the aliases or adding it to `filenames.txt`.
