# FatCow Icons

This is a set of iconsfrom FatCow at version 3.9.2 made available for free.

The original home of these icons is at https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons.

**I am allowed to host these icons here by the FatCow support.**

- Implement loading icons as the user scrolls the page but with a check after a delay
  to prevent all icons, only those that remained on the page for a while so that not
  all icons get loaded if the users scrolls the page fast (skimming) and display a
  loading indicator while the icon is waiting to see if it should load and then also
  while it is loading and display an empty pixel otherwise so that there isn't the
  browser default broken image fallback bitmap
